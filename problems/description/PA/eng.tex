\textbf{\large Problem Description}

The Jaccard similarity coefficient is usually used for measuring the similarity of 
two sets. Give two sets $A$ and $B$, the Jaccard similarity coefficient, $J(A,B)$, 
is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the 
two sets. That is, $J(A,B)= \frac{|A\cap B|}{|A\cup B|}$. For example, if 
$A=\{1, 3, 7 , 8\}$ and $B=\{1, 7, 9\}$, then 
$J(A, B)=\frac{|\{1,7\}|}{|\{1, 3, 7, 8, 9\}|}=\frac{2}{5}$.

Assume the element $i$ in the set is an integer between $0$ to $9$ ($0\le i\le9$) 
and the size of the set is no larger than $10$. Please write a program to compute 
the Jaccard similarity coefficient of two sets $A$ and $B$. And output 1 if 
$J(A,B)>0.5$ and $0$ if $J(A,B)\le0.5$.

\textbf{\large Input Format}

The first line of the input file contains an integer $T$ ($T\le25$) indicating 
the number of test cases to follow. 

Each test case will consist of three lines. The first line contains two integers 
$m$ and $n$ ($0<m, n\le 10$), indicating the number of elements of sets $A$ and $B$, 
respectively. The second line contains $m$ integers (the elements of set $A$) and 
the third line contains $n$ integers (the elements of set $B$). 

You may assume:
\begin{itemize}
    \tightlist{}
    \item $1 \le T \le 25$
    \item $m\le 10$ and $n \le 10$
\end{itemize}


\textbf{\large Output Format}

For each test case, output $1$ if $J(A,B)>0.5$ and $0$ if $J(A,B)\le0.5$.
